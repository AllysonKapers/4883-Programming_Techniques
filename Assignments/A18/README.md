## Github - Assignment Organization

### Overview

You should have solutions for the problems below uploaded to UVA Online judge. My last go-round with this course we did **18 problems!** [HERE](2020_fall.pdf) is the checklist. However, I like what we accomplished this semester. Could we have done more? Sure. I know I need to get a lecture prepared for some of these minimization and/or dynamic programming problems we've discussed this last week. Having said that, I've really enjoyed this semester and learned quite a bit as well!

Below is a checklist of problems from this semester. Don't forget the sort comparison project! That will be worth more than a single problem, that's for sure.

What should your github look like? I'm not sure. I had two formats in mind, one where each problem was in its own folder. However, I think we should stick to the following since the assignment names (A01-A0XX) will line up with the grade-book easier:

```
📁─Assignments
    📁─A01
    │   📄──README.md
    📁─A02
    │   📄──README.md
    📁─A03
    │   📄──README.md
    📁─A04
    │   📁─10055
    │   │   📄──README.md
    │   📄──README.md
    📁─A05
    │   📁─161

    📁─A06

        📁─10226
        │   📄──README.md
        📄──README.md
ETC
```
If you think there is a more logical way to organize your repository, please let me know. 


The grade book I mentioned is the D2L grade-book. I've only imported last years for now. And since the majority of you are still struggling with some problems, I'm being nice and will look at your submissions as a whole around the day of the final exam. 
Below is a list of the problems you are supposed to have finished. I would appreciate if next week we rate the problems from 1 to 3 with 1 being easy (like assignment A14) and 3 being hard. 

I made these changes to the grading scheme. If you think this is unfair, let me know. I think it helps those who couldn't get all the problems solved, and with the "presentation" really being just leading a group discussion, that gives you an easy grade bump. 

| Categories      | Portion of Course |  \|\|   | Letter Grade | Grade Range |
| :-------------- | :---------------: | --- | :----------: | :---------: |
| Solved Problems |        65%        |  \|\|   |      A       |   89-100    |
| Github          |        10%        |  \|\|   |      B       |    79-88    |
| Participation   |        5%         |  \|\|   |      C       |    69-78    |
| Presentation    |        10%        |  \|\|   |      D       |    59-68    |
| Project         |        10%        |  \|\|   |      F       |  below 59   |
|                 |                   |  \|\|   |              |             |

More clarification on things as we discuss next week in class.
