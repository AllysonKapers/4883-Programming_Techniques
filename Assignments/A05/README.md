## Assignment 5 - Presentation or Problem Selection
#### Due: Individual Due Dates


### Overview

At least once, but preferably twice you must present your steps for solving a UVA problem to the class. Your presentation should take 10-15 minutes depending on the problems complexity. One time will give allow you to start at an 85 for your grade. Twice will give you a starting grade of 100.


### Requirements

Here is what you should discuss:
- Problem Statement
  - Break down the problem statement starting with the problem description.
  - Include ways of rephrasing the problem so its more understandable in laymen terms.
  - Mention possible pitfalls or traps that you discover. There's always something to "lookout for". 
  - Go through which programming paradigms you thought of applying to this problem. 
- Input
  - Discuss any problems with the input
  - Did the input format cause and issues?
  - Where there many cases that existed not in the example input set?
- Output
  - Did the order of the output play in to the solution of the problem?
  - Did output format pose problems?
- Of course, comment your code accordingly.


### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `presentations` in your assignments folder.
- Create a folder `x` in your presentations folder where `x` = UVA problem number.
- Place the `pdf` of the problem, your `solution.cpp` to the problem and a `README.md` discussing everything stated in the requirements.
