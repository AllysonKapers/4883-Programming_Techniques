## Program Set 6 - Recursion
#### Due: 11-02-2020 (Mon @ 1:00 p.m.)


### Overview

So I was looking for topics to discuss today and ran across "Tower of Hanoi". This was discussed A LOT when I was a young whipper snapper. It is a classical "recursive backtracking" problem.

This [youtube video](https://youtu.be/2SUvWfNJSsM) discusses the problem, but even better its by a guy who does awesome videos in general. His channel is called "Three Blue One Brown" and his name is Grant Sanderson. My appreciation for his videos was reinforced  since I learned a new way to approach solving Towers of Hanoi by watching his video.

Here is [his general channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)

He has a ted talk as well that is worth watching: ["What Makes People Engage with Math"](https://youtu.be/s_L-fp8gDzY)
I found his channel when Dr. Lopez and I were looking for materials to help teach the basics of machine learning. Grant has another amazing video on neural nets which discusses the basic concepts: https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk

So I got off track. I guess I have a slight man crush on Grant and his videos. If you watch anything, for sure watch the first link about towers of Hanoi, but watch his ted talk, its very interesting and entertaining. Now back to UVa problems..
So read the problem description on [page 390 of CP3](https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/cp3/), and then do problem [**UVa 10017 - The Never Ending Towers of Hanoi**](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=12&page=show_problem&problem=958)
See you guys on Wednesday and I'm writing a program right now that will pick someone at random to discuss a problem.
Sooooo be ready !!!


Do the following:
- [UVa 10017 - The Never Ending Towers of Hanoi](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=12&page=show_problem&problem=958)
