## Assignment 6 - Polygon Problem Walkthrough
#### Due: 21-Oct-2020 (Wednesday @ 1:00 p.m.)


### Overview

Find 2 problems on page 293, or chapter 7 really, that you could verbally explain and walk someone through to a solution This doesn't mean you have to have it solved and uploaded, just understand the problem enough to point someone in the correct direction. 

### Requirements

- Be able to verbally walk someone through 2 problems. You may be called on in class to do so.
- Write one of your walkthroughs up and place it in a README file in your assignments folder.
- Don't just google the solution. Try to understand the problem without any resources first and write down your initial understanding and approach to solving it. 
- After you are pretty sure you either have it figured out, OR you don't have a clue, then find additional resources to get you to the finish line. 
- Start today and give yourself time to think about the problem. Do not wait until Wednesday morning to do the assignment. 

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called A06 in your assignments folder.
- Put the pdf of the problem your doing the walkthrough for in the folder.
- Create a `README.md` that describes your solution.
  - Cites sources of where you looked for help.
  - Gives a detailed journey on your approach to the problem.
