### Vectors

This problem can use arrays or vectors as part of its solution. Not sure what the fastest solutions use, but I went the route of using a lookup table to help me solve the problem. I have invited the world famous Professor Simpson to discuss the use of vectors in C++, and I figure since the problem is so easy to solve, it would be a good place to use vectors if you're not familiar with them.
