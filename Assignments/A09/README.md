### Overview

So we talked about this earlier this semester: "Towers of Hanoi". It is a classical "recursive backtracking" problem.

This [youtube video](https://youtu.be/2SUvWfNJSsM) discusses the problem, but even better its by a guy who does awesome videos in general. His channel is called "Three Blue One Brown" and his name is Grant Sanderson. I found his channel when Dr. Lopez and I were looking for materials to help teach the basics of machine learning. So, I started watching his videos for machine learning topics, and discovered he also talked about this exact problem. Here is [his general channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw). He has a ted talk as well that is worth watching: ["What Makes People Engage with Math"](https://youtu.be/s_L-fp8gDzY). Grant has another amazing video on neural nets which discusses the basic concepts: https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk

So I got off track but Grant's videos are great. If you watch anything, for sure watch the first link about towers of Hanoi, but watch his ted talk, its very interesting and entertaining. 

Now back to UVa problems..
So read the problem description on [page 390 of CP3](../../Resources/01_Book/cp_three.pdf), and then do problem [**UVa 10017 - The Never Ending Towers of Hanoi**](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=12&page=show_problem&problem=958)



Do the following:
