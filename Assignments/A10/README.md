### 920

The illustrative figure makes the problem very simple. Sort the points according to their x co-ordinates. Iterate from left to right. Whenever a point (peak) rises higher than the previous highest peek, then the light is incident to it. What we need to do is accumulate the distance from the current peak to the bottom end of the lit part. So, the problem comes to an intersection task which is trivial given proper tools <sup>[1]</sup>.
