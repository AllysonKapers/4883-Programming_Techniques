## Problem Presentation - Your Take on a Problem
#### Due: Multiple Dates

### Overview

1. Choose a problem
2. Have it ok'd by me
3. Put your problem number on the course [roster](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jAkhTTA8b8BxF5ckkyct44jOz8PNmREB9QxGERVDSeY/edit#gid=0)
4. Give us a 10-15 minute (minimum) run through on your approach to solving the problem.

### What to discuss

- Why you picked the problem
- Anything that stumped you
- What, if any, data structures or algorithms you used
- What problem solving paradigm (greedy, brute force, backtracking, DP)
- The most interesting discussions involve telling us just as much where you went wrong solving the problem. If you choose an easy problem, that doesn't involve a particular data structure, or any techniques, it will make for a boring talk.
- I will say that it would almost be more interesting if you discuss a problem that stumped you... Then let the class help you figure it out ... then come back at a subsequent class to give a 5 min update after you solved it.
