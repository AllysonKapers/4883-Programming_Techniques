## Sorting - Experiment
#### Due: 12-02-2021 (Thursday) @ 3:20 p.m.)

### Overview

Using the code from [L03](../../Lectures/L03/README.md) create an experiment to compare the sorting routines as discussed in class.  Most of the work is done for you. There is a driver program that times each sorting routine on the same data set, so all you need to do is vary the following about the data being sorted:

- size 
- type (integers, floats, strings)
- discombulation of data:
  - completely unsorted or random
  - partially unsorted (start with a sorted set and swap a percentage of the values)
  - reverse sorted (sort into ascending order a set that is descending)
  - already sorted

We can discuss this more in class,  but if I write too much I will basically write the experiment for you since I did already organize all the code into project form.

### Deliverables

- Create a folder under your `assignments` folder on github called `A16`.
- Create a README.md file describing your setup and experiment.
- Include charts created via excel or google sheets.
