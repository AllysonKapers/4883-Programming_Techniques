## File Legend

| Folder Name | Description |
|:-----------|:-------------|
|xx-**A**xx | This is some kind of an ***Assignment***, where an `assignment` can be anything that isn't big enough to be a full fledged program, and not specific enough to be a homework. |
|xx-**H**xx | This is a ***Homework***. Something pretty specific, usually not requiring a lot of programming. |
|xx-**P**xx | This is a ***Program***. Where it must be compiled, run error free, commented, and correct. |
|xx-**T**xx | This is a ***Test***. Usually when on github, it will start out as a study guide, then get accompanied with a solution after the exam. |
